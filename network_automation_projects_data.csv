Dual Site 3-Tier Network Lab;A comprehensive GNS3 simulation of a resilient, dual-site enterprise network using a three-tier architecture. Implements OSPF, HSRP, NAT, and advanced Layer 2 security.;https://github.com/OmrSanchez/Dual-Site-3-Tier-Network-Lab.git;net_8.png;'';Goal: To design and build a complete enterprise network from the ground up in GNS3. It serves as a practical showcase of my mastery of core routing, switching, and security principles, integrating key technologies like OSPF, HSRP, and advanced Layer 2 security to create a resilient and scalable infrastructure.
WGU Capstone - Network Design;A comprehensive capstone project involving the design, implementation, and testing of a secure, multi-site enterprise network. The architecture features a collapsed-core design, a site-to-site IPsec VPN, and high availability with HSRP. The network utilizes a hybrid routing scheme with BGP for external connectivity and OSPF for internal routing, all supported by a full suite of centralized network services and a multi-layered security model including firewalls, ACLs, and 802.1x.;https://github.com/OmrSanchez/WGU-Capstone-Network-Project;net_7.png;"";Goal: To demonstrate end-to-end network engineering capabilities, from initial architectural design and IP planning to advanced routing, high-availability, and defense-in-depth security implementation in a simulated enterprise environment.
Managing Access Control in Windows Server;A project demonstrating core system administration skills, including the configuration of DHCP and DNS servers, and the implementation of Active Directory for organizing and securing network resources through Group Policy.;https://github.com/OmrSanchez/Project-System-and-Network-Administration.git;net_1.png;AD_vid.mp4;Goal: To showcase proficiency in managing foundational enterprise services like Active Directory, DNS, and DHCP, which are critical for any network infrastructure.
Network Performance and Sniffing;A project showcasing the use of Windows Performance Monitor to baseline network metrics and Wireshark to perform packet sniffing on a file transfer between a client PC and a server, demonstrating traffic analysis skills.;https://github.com/OmrSanchez/Project-System-and-Network-Administration.git;net_2.png;Project - Basic Network Performance Monitoring and Sniffing.mp4;Goal: To establish a foundational ability to use industry-standard tools like Performance Monitor and Wireshark for network traffic collection and packet-level analysis.
Host Discovery and Port Scanning;A demonstration of network reconnaissance techniques using tools within Kali Linux, including netdiscover and nmap, to perform host discovery and scan for open ports on a target server in a virtualized environment.;https://github.com/OmrSanchez/Project-System-and-Network-Administration;net_3.png;Project - Host Discovery and Port Scanning.mp4;Goal: To confirm my practical knowledge of network mapping and security assessment techniques used to identify active devices and potential vulnerabilities.
Resolve Connectivity Issues;A lab scenario focused on network forensics where I utilized troubleshooting tools and methodologies to diagnose a connectivity issue, identify the root cause, and implement a verifiable solution.;https://github.com/OmrSanchez/LAB-Project---Resolve-Connectivity-Issues.git;net_4.png;"";Goal: To demonstrate a systematic and meticulous approach to network troubleshooting, moving from issue identification and analysis to successful resolution.
Fix Firewall ACL;A troubleshooting lab where a misconfigured firewall Access Control List (ACL) was disrupting server connectivity. The project involved analyzing the rule set, identifying the incorrect entry, and applying a fix to restore proper traffic flow.;https://github.com/OmrSanchez/LAB-Project---Firewall.git;net_5.png;'';Goal:  To solidify and demonstrate an understanding of firewall rule processing and the ability to troubleshoot complex connectivity issues caused by ACL misconfigurations.
DNS Server Change;A lab scenario where a recent DNS server change caused a service outage for a group of users. I worked through the problem by gathering information, identifying the scope of the issue, and implementing the correct DNS changes to resolve it.;https://github.com/OmrSanchez/Lab-Project---DNS.git;net_6.png;'';Goal: To showcase methodical troubleshooting by using available information to pinpoint a DNS configuration error and apply the correct fix to restore service.
